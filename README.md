# Magic ML Mixer: Make Mixes from your Top Spotify Listens using sklearn KMeans

If you're like me and just dump all songs into the standard *"Liked Songs"* i.e don't have the patience to maintain different playlists - then this is for you.

Let DJ Python ðŸŽ§ with some magic ML, cluster your Liked Songs into mixes ðŸª„

## What is covered in the `MLMagicMixer.ipynb`:

1. Authenticating a Spotipy Client instance with our creds, to fetch our Top Listens.
2. Get Audio Features for each of the fetched Tracks, and see how the features change/correlate across our Tracks
3. Perform `KMeans clustering` to make new Mix(s)!
4. Finally, add these new Mix(s) to our Spotify account ðŸš€
